# Hack the Valley9 Project
_Gamifying the eating disorder recovery process through positive habit building and rewards._

## Description
Millions of young people, especially kids and teens, suffer from eating disorders, often feeling overwhelmed by the recovery process. Traditional recovery tools, such as calorie tracking, can further entrench unhealthy behaviours, and are often not suited for younger age groups. Inspired by the need to promote healthy habits in a fun, supportive way, we designed an app that gamifies the recovery process, helping to destigmatize eating disorders and support positive change.
